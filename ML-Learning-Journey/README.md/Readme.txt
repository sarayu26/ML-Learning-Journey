# Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository contains Jupyter/Colab notebooks focused on key machine learning concepts including:

- **Binary Classification:** Breast cancer detection using Logistic Regression.
- **Multiclass Classification:** Iris species prediction with Logistic Regression.
- **Regression:** Linear regression on various datasets including housing prices.
- **Decision Trees:** Classification of Iris dataset with Decision Trees.

Each folder contains notebooks with detailed explanations, visualizations, and code to illustrate these concepts.

## How to Use

Open the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or locally with Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the code.
